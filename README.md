## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Tailwindcss
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript

### What I learned

I used this project to learn Tailwindcss as I have never used it before, and I must say I am in love with this utility-first framework. I got familiar with many of the classes that Tailwindcss offers and makes it easy to build a site with.

### Continued development

Use this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect.

**Note: Delete this note and the content within this section and replace with your own plans for continued development.**

### Useful resources

- [Resource 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFgzHOX84xQ) - This tutorial helped me a lot with the challenge as it is the same challenge that is used in the tutorial, i only started learning Tailwindcss a few days ago and I needed to get a better understanding of it, now I know how to add most of the needed classes for building a unique layout for my projects.
